    <p class="para">Dwight Howard is by far one of the best rebounders to have played in the NBA. His average of 15.3 boards per game this season is almost 2 more rebounds than his closest competitor. His career average in rebounds per game is 12.9, which is 12th all time. He has also grabbed 79 offensive boards this season putting him 5th on that list.

        For someone that ranks first in total rebounds, defensive rebounds, and rebounds per game making him the number one rebound in the game right now only seems right.</p>
    <p class="para">Howard reported to camp for his second NBA season having added 20 pounds of muscle during the off-season. Orlando coach Brian Hill—responsible for grooming former Magic superstar Shaquille O'Neal—decided that Howard should be converted into a full-fledged center. Hill identified two areas where Howard needed to improve: his post-up game and his defense</p>

        <p class="para">Kevin Love is arguably the games best power forward at the moment for his scoring and rebounding powers.

            The second leading rebounder this season is averaging 13.5 boards per game 4.1 of which come of the offensive glass.
            
            The only reason why he gets put down to number two on my list is that his career average rebounding is only 11.9. This may seem like quite a large number but when you are playing in the same era as…</p>

        <img src="images/gasol.jpeg" alt="Gasol-img" class="img">
        <p class="para">Pau Gasol’s younger brother Marc Gasol has Pau beat on this level. 

In his fourth year in the NBA and with the Memphis Grizzlies, Marc Gasol is currently tied with the third most rebounds in the league right now with 210 on the season. 

He is one pace to have his highest rebounding season he has ever had by at least one board per game. With many years still left in him, Marc should be able to put up some impressive rebounding numbers.</p>

        <img src="images/Anderson.jpg.crdownload" alt="Anderson-img" class="img">
        <p class="para">Anderson Varejao is from Santa Teresa, Brazil and in his eighth season in the NBA, all of which have come with the Cleveland Cavaliers.

As a rebounder Varejao is quickly becoming a much better rebounder since his rookie season during he only grabbed 4.8 boards per game.

He is now averaging a career high 11 boards per game this season. If he can keep up this pace for another few seasons he could easily be moved farther up this list.</p>

        <img src="images/blake.jpeg" alt="Blake-img" class="img">
        <p class="para">Blake Griffin is one of the flashiest players in the NBA right now. Although he is mainly known for his high flying and acrobatic dunks, he is also a decent rebounder.

Tied for 12th for total rebounds Griffin is averaging 11.1 boards per game, which is 4th in the league. If he could turn his style into rebounds he could easily move up this list.</p>
